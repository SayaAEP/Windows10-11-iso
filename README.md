i check and update every 1 month
the iso compiled on linux with uup dump https://uupdump.net/

me when complete compiling isos i upload to archive.org cause github release max size is 2gb

# For GitHub staff
please dont remove or suspend this account maybe you look my workspaces and you notice im installing VNC and xfce4, with that me can easyly compiling windows isos with gui (maybe you know uupdump compile windows isos without gui, but i use as easy copy move files, etx , idk i have no words)

# Alternative Workspace
